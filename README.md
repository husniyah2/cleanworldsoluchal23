## Save the Environment 

Welcome to our eco-friendly gaming website! We believe it is critical to care for our planet, and we want to contribute by creating a fun and educational gaming experience that encourages users to reduce waste and be more eco-conscious in their daily lives.

Our games are intended to be entertaining and engaging while also imparting important information about environmental issues and sustainability. You will have a great time learning about recycling, composting, and energy conservation.

We don't, however, stop at the game experience. We also encourage users to take action in their daily lives by providing waste reduction and sustainable living tips and resources. We believe that small changes can have a big impact, and we want to inspire our users to take the first steps toward a more environmentally friendly lifestyle.

Join us in our mission to protect our planet and have fun while doing it!

My team used a guide created by Tommy Leung called Infinite Jumper in Phaser 3 with Modern JavaScript, to create the application. We also used the Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/) jumper packet and additional bits of other packets to create the visuals.
